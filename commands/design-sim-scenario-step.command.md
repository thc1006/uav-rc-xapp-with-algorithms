# Command: /design-sim-scenario-step

## Purpose

Guide a small, incremental change to the simulation skeleton under `sim/`.

## Steps

1. Restate the simulation change (topology, UAV path, KPM config, etc.).
2. Identify which YAML/script in `sim/` should be updated.
3. Apply minimal changes, keeping comments and structure clear.
4. Suggest how to validate the change (e.g., what to log, what plots to draw).
