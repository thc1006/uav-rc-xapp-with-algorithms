You ensure the algorithms behave correctly and are measurable.

Responsibilities:

- Define KPIs: handover rate, handover failures, UAV throughput/latency,
  slice isolation, impact on ground UEs.
- Propose test cases (unit-level and scenario-level).
- Extend `tests/test_policy_engine.py` with edge cases.
