## 4.2 Flight path based dynamic UAV radio resource allocation

### 4.2.1 Background information
This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for the support the use case of flight path based dynamic UAV radio resource allocation, allowing operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the ORAN architecture, reducing unnecessary handover and improving radio resource utilization.

### 4.2.2 Motivation
The field trials’ results show that the coverage for low altitude is good and can provide various services for terrestrial UEs with good performance. However, since the site along the flight is mainly for terrestrial UEs, the altitude of the UAV is always not within the main lobe of the ground station antenna. And the side lobes give rise to the phenomenon of scattered cell associations particularly noticeable in the sky. The cell association pattern on the ground is ideally contiguous area where the best cell is most often the one closest to the UE. As the UE move up in height, the antenna side lobes start to be visible, and there is a possibility of the best cell no longer being the closest one. The cell association pattern in this particular scenario becomes fragmented especially at the height of 300m and above. Hence, at higher altitudes, several challenges that lead to a different radio environment are:

- LOS propagation/uplink interference
- Poor KPI caused by antenna side lobes for base stations
- Sudden drop in signal strength

These challenges directly impact on the mobility performance of the drone and the service experience of the user. Hence, we would like to support the use case of flight path based dynamic UAV radio resource allocation to resolve the above issues.

### 4.2.3 Proposed solution
To manage resource allocation of UAVs based on flight path, Non-RT RIC retrieves necessary aerial vehicles related metrics from network level measurement reports. Moreover, flight path information of aerial vehicle, climate information, flight forbidden/limitation area information and space load information are received from an application, e.g., UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML model. For example, this could be UL/DL interference from/to aerial vehicles, the detection of aerial vehicle UEs, and available radio resource (e.g., frequency, cell, beam, BWP, numerology) prediction. The Near-RT RIC supports deployment and execution of AI/ML model from NonRT RIC. Based on this, Near-RT RIC can perform the radio resource allocation for UAVs considering the radio channel condition, flight path information and other application information with on-demand coverage. Moreover, aerial vehicles performance reports should be sent to Non-RT RIC for evaluation and optimization of the ML model.

### 4.2.4 Benefits of O-RAN architecture
An effective functional module, retrieving the application information, performing machine learning and training is not provided by current gNB/eNB architecture. Though, the O-RAN architecture components can collect both the acquired application information and radio environment information and execute AI/ML models based on received information. The flight path based dynamic UAV radio resource allocation mechanism can be supported by the RIC function modules, i.e. Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC. Therefore, we provide the description of O-RAN support use case for flight path based dynamic UAV radio resource.

## 4.3 Radio resource allocation for UAV application scenario

### 4.3.1 Background information
As shown in figure 4.3.1-1, this scenario refers to a rotor UAV flying at low altitude and low speed and carrying cameras, sensors and other devices mounted. The operation terminal uses the 5.8 GHz frequency band remote control the UAV for border/forest inspection, high voltage/base station inspection, field mapping, pollution sampling, and HD live broadcast. At the same time, the UAV control mobile station and the UAV anti-weapon combination provide the UAV control, fight against illegal UAV and other services to ensure low-altitude safety in special areas. The UAV operation terminal, the anti-UAV weapon, and the UAV control mobile station are connected with the UAV control vehicle using 5G network. UAV control vehicle deploys network equipment, including O-CU,O-DU, the Non-RT RIC, the Near-RT RIC function modules and application server (in this use case, it is an edge computing service platform) to provide reliable network services through 5G networks.

### 4.3.2 Motivation
UAV terminal access is a new scenario of 5G networks. It has a large amount of high real-time data that is more suitable for local processing. For the existing radio resource allocation strategy, there is no solution for such uplink high-rate data transmission. In this use case, UAV control vehicle is required to provide reliable network services through 5G networks. The data of the UAV terminal interacting with the network includes control data and application data, and the control data includes navigation commands, configuration changes, flight status data reporting, etc. Control data requires low latency and low bandwidth requirements. The application data includes 4K high-definition video data, which has obvious uplink and downlink service asymmetry, and the uplink has high requirements on network bandwidth. The UAV control vehicle deploys edge computing services that application services and content are placed on the edge instead of core network so that local processing of video and control information can be managed. At the same time, realtime data services can be provided to third-party applications through a video server.

### 4.3.3 Proposed solution
As shown in figure 4.3.3-1, this use case involves two options of network architecture. Option A is that O-CU, O-DU and Near-RT RIC are deployed on the control vehicle, Non-RT RIC and core network are deployed on the central cloud. The control vehicle is connected to core network and Non-RT RIC via fiber optics. Option B is a private network, all modules, including the gNB, Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC and the necessary core network function modules, are deployed in the control vehicle. In both deployment options, radio resource allocation for UAV application use case requires some of the basic functionalities of the O-RAN components. Non-RT RIC should retrieve UE-level radio resource requirements from application server to generate UE based radio resource allocation policies. In this scenario, Near-RT RIC should support execution and interpretation of retrieved policies to create configuration parameters to be applied on the E2 nodes. In addition to UE-specific radio resource adjustment with respect to received parameters, E2 nodes should provide information about UE registration or UE status change to Near-RT RIC so that it can be transferred to application server. As it is stated in previous clause, UAV terminals require low latency and high throughput in the uplink direction. For this reason, application server is needed to receive user plane data from UAV terminals.

### 4.3.4 Benefits of O-RAN architecture
The 5G network supports real-time high-definition video transmission and remote low-latency control of UAV, and finally provides various industry services such as inspection, security, surveying, and mapping. In the UAV control vehicle application scenario, there are a small amount of control data interaction requirements between the terminal and the network interaction, as well as the large bandwidth requirements for uploading HD video. The service asymmetry raises new requirements for resource allocation of the gNB. At the same time, the existing network operation and maintenance management platform (OSS system) can only optimize the parameters of a specific group of UEs, but not for individual users. Therefore, under the O-RAN architecture, the radio resource requirements for different terminals are sent to the gNB for execution by means of the Near-RT RIC function module. The UAV control vehicle has flexible layout features. In this use case, the application service and content are deployed on the edge computing platform instead of the core network; the Non-RT RIC function module is used to schedule radio resources instead of the core network's QoS mechanism. In this way, the load and overhead of the core network can be reduced, and the forwarding and processing time in data transmission can be reduced, and the delay can be reduced.
